Hello, this is my lab home work for Module 3, which contains the blog card and qr code.

How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
It was great, I am a very visual person, and so just being able to focus on replicating something
that already exists was very freeing for the brain to just focus on code.

What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?
Nothing much, I'm mostly still building familiarity with CSS, and so I have a lot of learning curves.

How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?
I'm sure it can be helpful in the sense that people can easily help correct your code, instead of spending
alot of time alone. And from the responses I see on coding forums, there is a lot of great advice 
and lots of helpful people.
